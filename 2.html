<h3>2.	Improve air quality</h3>
Indoor plant can significantly decrease the amount of different pollutants in the air around it. In an experiment, after putting 7 different plants into the closed environment, the concentration of benzene, methane and other hundred types of toxic compound have significantly decreased.
<div style="border:1px solid black; padding: 10px;margin: 10px;">In static test-chambers, high air-borne doses of benzene were removed within 24 h, once the response had been stimulated (‘induced’) by an initial dose. Removal rates per pot ranged from 12-27 ppm d−1 (40 to 88 mg m−3 d−1) (2.5 to 5 times the Australian maximum allowable occupational level). Rates were maintained in light or dark, and rose about linearly with increased dose.</div>
Sometimes cause of people are living in a closed environment, and the industrial product (or house material) can emit toxic chemical, the air inside the room can be even more toxic than the air outside. As the effect of plant is real, buying a pot of plant and put it into home is a great idea for improving the air quality especially the room without window. 
(You should also concern about plant type, because some plants need displayed near window to get touch with sunlight)
However, if you just had your paint dried, and smelly air is floating inside your room, don’t rely on an air purifier nor pot of plants and wishing for the magic of purity, open the window and leaves it few days.
