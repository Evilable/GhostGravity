        <p class='col-8'>We’re an environmental charity with a difference. Our purpose is to inspire ways of living 
            that are good for the environment. We do this by designing campaigns that make 
            environmental actions desirable. We disrupt the status quo to raise awareness, nudge 
            behaviours and shape systems. We do this with knowledge and playfulness, and we 
            won’t make you feel bad. <br>
            Design By Nature, brought to you by Hubbub, is an initiative that challenges students to 
            find new ways to tackle environmental issues affecting our day-to-day lives. We celebrate 
            innovation, creativity, disruptive thinking, collaboration and insight-led ideas that make 
            sustainable living second nature.</p></div></div>

        We believe that to create positive environmental change at the 
        scale and speed needed, we need to get everyone on board. 
        That's why since 2014, we've been designing campaigns that 
        inspire ways of living that are good for the environment. We 
        disrupt the status quo to raise awareness, nudge behaviours 
        and shape systems. We do this with knowledge and playfulness, 
        and we won’t make you feel bad (promise!).

        <div class="panel col-8">
            Awareness of climate change and sustainability in mainstream 
            media has risen a lot in past years. This is good, but many still 
            feel detached from environmental issues and are desensitised to 
            negative messaging and imagery. It makes changing their behaviour 
            challenging. We want to reach this audience by communicating 
            complex environmental issues in new, innovative ways. There is a 
            place for hard facts about climate change, but we believe there should 
            also be a place for optimism.

    <button class="accordion col-12">What do we do</button>
        <div class="panel col-8">
            <img src="images/about2.jpg" style="width:75%;margin: auto; display: block;">
            We concentrate on things people care about and are relevant 
            day-to-day, like the food we eat, the clothes we wear, our homes 
            and our neighbourhoods. We keep things simple, offering practical 
            and realistic solutions that help cut waste, make clothes last longer, 
            save money and more often than not bring people together. <br>
            Our campaigns tackle environmental issues, from food waste to 
            microfibres and (almost) everything in between. Curious?         
        </div>
    <button class="accordion col-12">Design and Innovation is key</button>
        <div class="panel col-8">
            We believe insight-led, experimental and collaborative design should 
            be at the heart of solving environmental issues. Over the years we’ve 
            seen how impactful great design can be in nudging behaviours. Our 100 
            community fridges (including two Samsung smart fridges in universities) 
            offer an easy solution to redistributiing surplus food and can save the 
            equivalent of 1.5 million meals per year from being wasted. The boats 
            we make from 99% recycled plastic not only tell a brilliant story of 
            the circular economy but more importantly, they are durable, highly 
            practical and look great! The ‘Ballot Bin’ cigarette voting ashtray reduces 
            cigarette littering by up to 46% and prevents plastics and chemicals 
            from entering our waterways. <br>
            <img src="images/about3.jfif" style="width:75%;margin: auto; display: block;">
            Especially in a post COVID-19 world, new forms of design, technology 
            and different solutions are needed to address the scale of the 
            environmental challenge we face. 
            That’s where Design By Nature comes in!
